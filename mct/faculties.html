					<p>The fac was raised in 1946 as No 1 Wg of the erstwhile School of Signals to impart tac trg. The first Officer to comd No 1 Wg was Maj (later Brig) Apar Singh, MBE. Later in Jan 1949, it came to be known as Tac Wg and Maj KD Bhasin was the first Offr Comdg. On 01 Oct 1967, the School of Sigs was re-designated as Military College of Telecommunication Engineering and the Wgs were renamed as fac. The Tac Wg came to be known as Fac of Combat Comns (FCC) and Lt Col (Later Maj Gen) Suljit Singh became the first Fac Cdr.In Jan 1979, the Electronic Warfare (EW) Wg was added to the fac and the fac was re-designated as Fac of Combat Comns and Electronic Warfare (FCC & EW). Since EW was considered integral to combat comns, the word “Electronic Warfare” was later dropped from the name of the Fac. In Jun 2012, the Fac was re-named as FCC & EW and has been nominated as the “ Centre of Excellence for Electronic Warfare”.</p>
