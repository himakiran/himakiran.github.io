This tutorial is divided in three sections. First section provides a basic overview of Subnetting tools. Second section explains Subnetting process in easy steps. Last section includes Subnetting examples for beginners.</p><h2>Subnetting</h2><p>Subnetting is a process of dividing large network into the smaller networks based on layer 3 IP address.
Every computer on network has an IP address that represent its location on network.
Two version of IP addresses are available IPv4 and IPv6. In this article we will perform subnetting on IPv4.</p><h3>IPv4</h3><p>IP addresses are displayed in dotted decimal notation, and appear as four numbers separated by dots.
Each number of an IP address is made from eight individual bits known as octet. Each octet can create number value from 0 to 255.
An IP address would be 32 bits long in binary divided into the two components, network component and host component.
Network component is used to identify the network  that the packet is intend for,
and host component is used to identify the individual host on network.</p><p>IP addresses are broken into the two components:</p><p><b class="text-orange">Network component :-</b> Defines network segment of device.</p><p><b class="text-red">Host component :-</b> Defines the specific device on a particular network segment</p><h5>IP Classes in decimal notation</h5><div class="code"><pre>  Class A addresses range from 1-126
  Class B addresses range from 128-191
  Class C addresses range from 192-223
  Class D addresses range from 224-239
  Class E addresses range from 240-254
    </pre></div><ul class="ul-bullet"><li>0 [Zero] is reserved and represents all IP addresses.</li><li>127 is a reserved address and is used for testing, like a loop back on an interface.</li><li>255 is a reserved address and is used for broadcasting purposes.</li></ul><p>This tutorial is the second part of our article “Network Addressing Explained with Subnetting and VLSM”.

Subnet mask is always used with IP address. Subnet mask has only one purpose,
to identify which part of an IP address is network address and which part is host address.</p><p>For example how will we figure out network partition and host partition from  IP address 192.168.1.10 ?
Here we  need subnet mask to  get details about network address and host address.</p><ul class="ul_arrow"><li>In decimal notation subnet mask value 1 to 255 represent network address and value 0 [Zero] represent host address.</li><li>In binary notation subnet mask <b>ON</b> bit [ 1] represent network address while <b>OFF</b> bit[0] represent host address.</li></ul><p><b>In decimal notation</b></p><div class="code"><pre>    IP address       192.168.1.10

    </pre></div><p>Network address is 11000000.10101000.00000001 and host address is 00001010</p><p><img src="./subnetmask.jpg" alt="Subnet mask" title="Subnet mask"></p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-hover"><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>255.0.0.0</td><td>First 8 bits</td><td>Last 24 bits</td><td>16, 777, 216</td><td>16, 777, 214</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>255.255.0.0</td><td>First 16 bits</td><td>Last 16 bits</td><td>65,536</td><td>65,534</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>255.255.255.0</td><td>First 24 bits</td><td>Last 8 bits</td><td>256</td><td>254</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Network ID</h3><p>First address of subnet is called network ID. This address is used to identify one segment or broadcast domain from all
the other segments in the network.</p><h3>Block Size</h3><p>Block size is the size of subnet including network address, hosts addresses and broadcast address.</p><h3>Broadcast ID</h3><p>There are two types of broadcast, direct broadcast and full broadcast.</p><p><b class="text-orange">Direct broadcast or local broadcast</b> is the last address of subnet and can be hear by all hosts in subnet.</p><p><b class="text-blue">Full broadcast</b> is the last address of IP classes and can be hear by all IP hosts in network. Full broadcast address is 255.255.255.255</p><p>The main difference between direct broadcast and full broadcast  is that routers will not propagate local broadcasts
between segments, but they will propagate directed broadcasts.</p><h3>Host Addresses</h3><p>All address between the network address and the directed broadcast address is called  host address for the subnet.
You can assign host addresses to any IP devices such as PCs, servers, routers, and switches.</p><h3>Subnetting</h3><p>Subnetting is a process of breaking large network in small networks known as subnets. Subnetting happens when we
extend default boundary of subnet mask. Basically we borrow host bits to create networks. Let's take a example</p><p class="text-info">Being a network administrator you are asked to create two networks, each will host 30 systems.</p><p> Single class C IP range can fulfill this requirement, still you have to purchase 2 class C IP range, one for each network. Single class C range
provides 256 total addresses and we need only 30 addresses, this will waste 226 addresses. These unused addresses would
make additional route advertisements slowing down the network.</p><p>With subnetting you only need to purchase single range of class C. You can configure router to take first 26 bits
instead of default 24 bits as network bits. In this case we would extend default boundary of subnet mask and borrow 2 host bits
to create networks. By taking two bits from the host range and counting them as network bits, we can create two new subnets, and
assign hosts them.  As long as the two new network bits match in the address, they belong to the same network.
You can change either of the two bits, and you would be in a new subnet.</p><h3>Advantage of Subnetting</h3><ul class="ul-star"><li>Subnetting breaks large network in smaller networks and smaller networks are easier to manage.</li><li>Subnetting reduces network traffic by removing collision and broadcast traffic, that overall improve performance.</li><li>Subnetting allows you to apply network security polices at the interconnection between subnets.</li><li>Subnetting allows you to save money by reducing requirement for IP range.</li></ul><h3>Subnetting math</h3><p>Subnetting process involves binary math calculation. Computers communicate with each other's in binary language.
To succeed in any kind of  networking career, you might be fluent in binary math calculation.
Subnetting needs two type of calculation, convert decimal to binary and convert binary to decimal.</p><p>Binary system works exactly same as decimal system, except the base number. Base number
is 2 in binary system and 10 in decimal system. To calculate decimal equivalent value of a binary number,
you have to replace base value 10 with 2.  Binary numbers are displayed in columns and each position in
binary system has double value than the position in right. From earlier section of this article you know
that each number of an IP address is made from eight individual bits known as octet. So you should remember
at least eight decimal equivalent value from binary position.</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-hover"><tbody><tr><td><b>Base position</b></td><td>2<sup>7</sup></td><td>2<sup>6</sup></td><td>2<sup>5</sup></td><td>2<sup>4</sup></td><td>2<sup>3</sup></td><td>2<sup>2</sup></td><td>2<sup>1</sup></td><td>2<sup>0</sup></td></tr><tr><td><b>Decimal value</b></td><td>128</td><td>64</td><td>32</td><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><b class="text-brown">Convert decimal to binary</b></p><p>To convert a decimal number in binary we would use addition till number method.
In this method we start adding from left to get target value. If after adding right position value,
sum is lower than target number, keep adding, or if sum is greater than target number
skip the position value. Only the value of on bit [1] will be added in sum. Off bit [0] has zero value.
For example, convert decimal number 117 in binary.</p><p>Target decimal number 117</p><p>Move direction  From Left  ===========================&gt; to Right</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-hover"><tbody><tr><td><b>Base position</b></td><td>2<sup>7</sup></td><td>2<sup>6</sup></td><td>2<sup>5</sup></td><td>2<sup>4</sup></td><td>2<sup>3</sup></td><td>2<sup>2</sup></td><td>2<sup>1</sup></td><td>2<sup>0</sup></td></tr><tr><td><b>Decimal value</b></td><td>128</td><td>64</td><td>32</td><td>16</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>Bit status</b></td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>Decimal value in addition</b></td><td>0</td><td>64</td><td>32</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Binary value of 117 is 01110101.</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-hover"><tbody><tr><td>128  is greater than 117</td><td>off the bit</td></tr><tr><td>0+64 = 64 is less than 117</td><td>on the bit</td></tr><tr><td>0+64+32 = 96 is less than 117</td><td>on the bit</td></tr><tr><td>0+64+32+16 = 112 is less than 117</td><td>on the bit</td></tr><tr><td>0+64+32+16+8 = 120 is greater than 117</td><td>off the bit</td></tr><tr><td>0+64+32+16+0+4 = 116 is less than 117</td><td>on the bit</td></tr><tr><td>0+64+32+16+0+4+2 = 118 is greater than 117</td><td>off the bit</td></tr><tr><td>0+64+32+16+0+4+0+1 =	117 is equivalent to 117</td><td>on the bit</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><b class="text-navy">Convert binary in decimal</b></p><p>To convert a binary in decimal we will follow above method in reverse mode.
We will find the decimal value of on binary bit position and add them.

Our next step is to figure out the combination provided by a binary position.</p><p>First bit provide two combination 0 or 1. If we take two bits than we have four combinations 00,01,10,11. IP address has 32 bits, so you should be able to find the number of combinations provided by each bit position until  position number 32.</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-hover"><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>17</td><td>131072</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>18</td><td>262144</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>19</td><td>524288</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16</td><td>20</td><td>1048576</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>32</td><td>21</td><td>2097152</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>64</td><td>22</td><td>4194304</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>128</td><td>23</td><td>8388608</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>256</td><td>24</td><td>16777216</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>512</td><td>25</td><td>33554432</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>1024</td><td>26</td><td>67108864</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>2048</td><td>27</td><td>134217728</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>4096</td><td>28</td><td>268435456</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>8192</td><td>29</td><td>536870912</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>16384</td><td>30</td><td>1073741824</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>32768</td><td>31</td><td>2147483648</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>65536</td><td>32</td><td>4294967296</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>Default subnet mask</h4><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-hover"><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>255.0.0.0</td><td>Network.Host.Host.Host</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>255.255.0.0</td><td>Network.Network.Host.Host</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>255.255.255.0</td><td>Network.Network.Network.Host</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>Key terms to remembers</h4><ul class="ul-arrow"><li>A subnet is a smaller portion of large network treated as its own separate network.

In slash notation it would be written as /24, means address has 24  bits on.</li></ul><h2>Method of subnetting</h2><p>In subnetting we find the answer of following questions.</p><ul class="ul-bullet"><li>What is subnet mask for given address?</li><li>How many subnets does given subnet mask provide ?</li><li>What is block size for given subnet mask?</li><li>What are the valid subnets?</li><li>What are the total hosts?</li><li>How many valid hosts are available per subnet?</li><li>What is broadcast address of each subnet?</li><li>What is network address of each subnet?</li></ul><p>To answer above questions we use following method of subnetting.</p><p><b class="text-brown">What is subnet mask for given address?</b></p><p>Subnetting take places when we extend the default subnet mask. We cannot perform subnetting with default
subnet mask and every classes have default subnet mask. To figure out subnetted subnet mask ,we first need
to write down the default subnet mask. Now find the host bits borrowed to create subnets and convert them in decimal.
For example find the subnet mask of address  188.25.45.48/20 ?  This address belong to class B and
class B has default subnet mask 255.255.0.0[ /16 in CIDR ]. We borrowed 4 bits from hosts portion.
As you know subnetting move from left to right and it cannot skip any network bit.
So this subnet mask in binary would be 11111111. 11111111.11110000.00000000.
First two octet have default value so its decimal value would be 255.255. We will convert third octet in decimal value.
To convert a binary number in decimal we add its decimal equivalent value.
In our example it would be 128+64+32+16+0+0+0+0 = 240. Our fourth octet has all bits off so its
decimal value would be 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 =0. Our answer subnet mask would be 255.255.240.0</p><p><b class="orange">How many subnets does given subnet mask provide ?</b></p><p>To calculate the number of subnets provided by given subnet mask we use 2<sup>N</sup> ,
where N = number of bits borrowed from host bits to create subnets. For example in 192.168.1.0/27, N is 3.
By looking at address we can determined that this address is belong to class C and class C has default
subnet mask 255.255.255.0 [/24 in CIDR]. In given address we borrowed 27 - 24 = 3 host bits to create subnets.
Now 2<sup>3</sup> = 8, so our answer is 8.</p><p><b class="text-blue">What is block size for subnet mask?</b></p><p>Block size or increment number is used to calculate the valid subnets. Once you figure out the block size,
calculation of valid subnets become piece of cake. To figure out the block size,
use this formula 256 - Subnet mask = block size.  For example block size
for subnet mask 255.255.255.240 is 256 - 240 = 16.</p><p><b class="text-red">What are the valid subnets?</b></p><p>Calculating valid subnet is two steps process. First calculate total subnet by using formula 2<sup>N</sup>.
In second step find the block size and count from zero in block until you reach the subnet mask value.
For example calculate the valid subnets for 192.168.1.0/26.</p><p> Borrowed host bits are 2 [26-24].<br> Total subnets are 2<sup>2</sup> = 4.<br> Subnet mask would be 255.255.255.192.<br> Block size would be 256-192 = 64.<br> Start counting from zero at blocks of 64, so our valid subnets would be 0,64,128,192.</p><p><b class="text-pink">What are the total hosts?</b></p><p>Total hosts are the hosts available per subnet. To calculate total hosts use formula 2<sup>H</sup> = Total hosts.
H is the number of host bits. For example in address 192.168.1.0/26
we have 32 - 26 [Total bits in IP address - Bits consumed by network address] = 6. Total hosts per subnet would be 2<sup>6</sup> = 64.</p><p><b class="text-navy">How many valid hosts are available per subnet?</b></p><p>Valid hosts are the number of hosts those can be assigned to devices. As we know, we need to reduce two address per subnet,
one for network ID and another for broadcast ID. So our formula, to calculate valid hosts would be Total hosts - 2 = Valid hosts.
In above example we have 64 hosts per subnet, so valid hosts in each subnet would be 64 - 2 = 62.</p><p><b class="text-blue">What is broadcast address of each subnet?</b></p><p>Broadcast address is the last address of subnet. This address is reserve for network broadcast,
and cannot be assigned to any host.  In above example</p><p>0 Subnet has broadcast address 63<br> 64 Subnet has broadcast address 127<br> 128 Subnet has broadcast address 191<br> 192 Subnet has broadcast address 255</p><p><b class="text-yellow">What is the network address of each subnet?</b></p><p>Network address is the first address of subnet. This address is used to locate the network,
and cannot be assigned to any host. In above example address 0,64,128,192 are the network address.</p><ul class="ul-arrow"><li>Network address is always the first IP address of subnet.</li><li>Broadcast address is always the last IP address of subnet ( IP address before the next subnet).</li><li>Valid hosts are the IP addresses between network address and broadcast address.</li></ul><p>At this point you have powered with all essential tools for subnetting. In last section of this article we will
practically implement what we have learn so far. Due to length of this article I will include examples only from class C.</p><h3>Class C  Subnetting</h3><p>Default subnet mask of class C is 255.255.255.0. CIDR notation of class C is /24, which means 24 bits from IP
address are already consumed by network portion and we have 8 host bits to work with. We cannot skip network bit,
when we turned them on. Subnetting  moves from left to right. So Class C subnet masks can only be the following:</p><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-hover"><tbody><tr><td>/25</td><td>128</td><td>10000000</td></tr><tr><td>/26</td><td>192</td><td>11000000</td></tr><tr><td>/27</td><td>224</td><td>11100000</td></tr><tr><td>/28</td><td>240</td><td>11110000</td></tr><tr><td>/29</td><td>248</td><td>11111000</td></tr><tr><td>/30</td><td>252</td><td>11111100</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As we have already discussed earlier in this article that we  have to have at least 2 host bits for
